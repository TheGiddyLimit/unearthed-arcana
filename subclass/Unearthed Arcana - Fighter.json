The target hit by the arrow takes a -10 penalty to speed, and it takes {@damage 2d6} slashing damage if it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can touch it can use its action to try to remove the brambles, which requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute."

As an action, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute, and make a ranged attack against it, using the Arcane Arrow. The arrow flies around corners if necessary, and this attack ignores three-quarters cover, half cover, and disadvantage caused by the target being out of sight or being at long range. The attack automatically misses if the target is out of the weapon's range or if there is no path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target. If the arrow hits its target, you know it, but you don't learn the target's location unless it's within your line of sight."
