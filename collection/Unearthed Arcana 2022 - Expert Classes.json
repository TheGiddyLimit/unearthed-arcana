The magic of Bards is an attempt to harness those words\u2014which transcend any language\u2014and direct them to create new wonders.",

Harnessing the Words of Creation requires hard work and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can sometimes be hard to spot the difference between these performers and Bards, though. A Bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards' depth of knowledge, level of musical skill, and mastery of magic sets them apart."
