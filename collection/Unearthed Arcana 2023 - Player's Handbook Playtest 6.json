The magic of Bards is an attempt to harness those words\u2014which transcend any language\u2014and direct them to create new wonders.",
						"Because the Words of Creation resonate throughout the cosmos, different Bards choose different approaches to their magic. Some Bards practice their arts in temples or monasteries, drawing on the power of the Outer Planes to channel divine magic. Others listen to bird song and the music of the wind, associate with Druid circles, and wield primal magic. Still others immerse themselves in the study of magical lore, collecting scraps of mystic knowledge wherever their journeys take them as they master the secrets of arcane magic. Ultimately, though, these various paths converge as the most accomplished Bards learn to access almost the entire breadth of magical potential.",
						"Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and develop an aptitude to do almost anything well. Bards become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.",
						"Not every singer or poet in a tavern or jester in a royal court is a Bard. Harnessing the Words of Creation requires hard work and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. A Bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards' depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart."

						"Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples or shrines dedicated to whatever deity or other immortal force unlocked their magical ability. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training, yet a Cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites that help them focus their minds and spirits on drawing power from the Outer Planes. Even a Cleric who declines to worship their divine benefactor might perform their benefactor's rites if doing so helps the Cleric feel connected to the immortal realms.",

Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Some of the most influential high priests are incapable of harnessing divine magic, and a few of them feel threatened when a Cleric appears. Many can pray, and some mortals claim to speak for the gods. But few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can."

Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some Druids focus on this practice, even to the point where they feel more natural in an animal form.",
						"For Druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world\u2014air, earth, fire, and water\u2014must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, Druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.",
						"Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat."

They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In their hands and guided by their power, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery. And their mightiest attacks can stun their opponents.",

Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.",

Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world's armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then, their loyalty is first to their sacred oaths, not to crown and country.",
						"Adventuring Paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or a dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Malign forces lurk in dungeons, and even the smallest victory against them can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion."
