										"Strength checks are useful for traps that can be destroyed or held back through brute force. A scything blade can be broken, a collapsing roof held in place, a net torn apart.",
										"Magical traps can be disabled by someone who can undermine the magic used to power them. An Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check allows a character to figure out how the trap functions and how to disable its magic. A statue that belches a jet of magical flame might be disabled when one of its glass eyes is shattered, disrupting the magic that powers it.",
										"Finally, decide if there are any drawbacks to a failed attempt to disable the trap. If so, pick a threshold for the check result or decide that any failure activates the trap. If the result hits that threshold or lower, the trap activates. This option is a useful tool to make a trap feel dangerous even if the characters have discovered it. A trap that can be disabled without any danger is like a monster that can't fight back. Of course, use logic to guide your decisions. This element makes a trap interesting, but it shouldn't come at the cost of making your game feel illogical or arbitrary. For instance, let's say your trap is a section of floor that opens to send characters tumbling into a pit. If the rogue attempting to disarm the pit stands next to the trap, it makes no sense for the rogue to fall in if the trap activates. Of course, you can remedy this by specifying that the character must lean over the trap or have one foot on it to reach and disable the mechanism."

These traps foil intruders before they can reach a critical location, giving the dungeon's denizens a chance to mount a defense.",

The alarm sounds, the guards arrive, they berate the clumsy goblin, and then they reset the trap. Of course, an alarm trap that is triggered on accident too often might fail to generate a quick response from defenders.",

										"In addition to the active steps a complex trap takes, it should also present a continual hazard. Often, the active and constant effects are the same thing. Imagine a hallway filled with whirling saw blades. On the trap's turn, the blades attack anyone in the hall. In addition, anyone who lingers in the hallway takes damage at the end of each of their turns, representing the constant threat the blades pose.",
										"A constant element should apply its effect to any character who ends their turn in that element's area. If an active element presents a threat when it isn't its turn, determine the threat it poses as a constant element. As a rule of thumb, keep the saving throw DC or attack bonus the same but reduce the damage by half.",
										"Avoid filling the entire encounter area with constant elements. Part of the puzzle of a complex trap lies in figuring out which areas are safe. A moment's respite can help add an element of pacing to a complex trap and give the characters the feeling that they aren't in constant peril. For example, walls that slam together might need to reset between slams, leaving them harmless when it isn't their turn."

										"Just as a battle is more interesting if the monsters change their tactics or unveil new abilities in later rounds, so too are complex traps more fun if their nature changes in some way. The whirling blades that protect a treasure chest do more damage each round, as they speed up. The poison gas in a room grows thicker as more of it floods the chamber, dealing more damage and blocking line of sight. The necrotic aura around an idol of Demogorgon produces random effects each time it triggers its active effect. As water floods a chamber, the characters must swim across areas they could walk through just a round or two before.",
										"Since complex traps remain active over the course of several rounds, they can pose an ongoing threat to intruders. However, if that threat becomes predictable its victims have a much better chance of thwarting it. Complex traps work best when they present multiple threats to intruders, ones that can change each round. The changes can include how a trap targets the characters (attack or even type of saving throw), the damage or effects it deals, the areas it covers, and so on. Some traps might have a random effect each round, while others follow a carefully programmed sequence of attacks designed to frustrate and slay intruders.",
										"Dynamic elements can occur on schedule. For a room that floods, you can plan out how the rising water level affects the area each round. The water might be ankle deep at the end of the first round, knee deep the next, and so on. Not only does the water carry a drowning risk, but it also makes it harder to move across the area; however, the rising water level might allow characters to swim to the upper reaches of the chamber that they couldn't reach from the floor.",
										"Dynamic elements can also come into play in reaction to the characters' actions. Disarming one element of the trap might make the others deadlier. Disabling a rune that triggers a firebreathing statue might cause the statue to explode, as the magic in it runs rampant. If a creature dies in the room, the idol to the god Nerull drains its soul and gains a new power.",
										"A trap's dynamic elements also make for a good timer. For example, the damage dealt by poison gas in a room starts at 11, but doubles each time the trap takes its turn. Smart players see that they only have a few rounds to overcome the trap before they must flee or risk death.",
										"Random dynamic elements are fun because they keep the players on their toes and make any plan made to foil it dependent on the luck of the dice. In this case, you create a table and roll on it to see how the trap changes. The players can never be sure what might happen next. As a rule of thumb, one random element for a complex trap is a good limit. A trap that is too random can feel arbitrary and frustrating. You want to make planning harder, not impossible.",
										"The dynamic elements should change after the trap's turn. The water level rises after the trap's active element takes its turn. The blades speed up and deal an additional die of damage each time they miss a character, their damage returning to its starting point after the impact of a successful attack causes them to slow down."

										"The advice on triggers given for simple traps applies to complex ones, with one exception. Complex traps feature multiple triggers, or are designed such that avoiding a trigger prevents intruders from reaching the area the trap guards. Other complex traps use magical triggers that activate on specific cues, such as when a door opens or someone enters an area without wearing the correct badge, amulet, or robe.",
										"Look at your map and consider when you want the trap to spring into action. It's best to have a complex trap trigger after the characters have committed to exploring an area. A simple trap might trigger when the characters open a door. A complex one that triggers that early leaves the PCs looking into the trapped room and perhaps opting to close the door and move on. A simple trap aims to keep intruders out. A complex trap wants to lure them in, so that when it activates, the intruders must deal with it to escape.",
										"In general, the trigger for a complex trap should be as foolproof as you can make it. A complex trap represents a serious expenditure of effort and magical power. No one builds one and makes it easy to avoid. Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) and Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) checks might be unable to spot a trigger, especially a magical one, but they can still give hints about the trap before it triggers. Blood stains, ashes, gouges in the floor, and so on can point to the trap's effects and give a warning."

										"A complex trap acts repeatedly, requiring you to note its initiative. Unlike characters and monsters, traps don't roll for initiative.

For instance, on initiative 20 blades sweep across a treasure vault, driving the characters back into the hallway.

														"A complex trap is like a legendary monster in some ways. It has several tricks it can use on its turn. It remains a threat throughout the round, not just on its turn. The trap's active elements are like a legendary creature's normal actions, and its constant elements are equivalent to legendary actions (except they are tied to specific areas in the trapped room).",
														"While a legendary creature can move, improvise actions, and so forth, a trap is set to a specific script, with the potential to make a complex trap stale.

										"A complex trap is never defeated with a single check. Instead, each successful check foils some part of it or degrades its performance. Each element of the trap must be overcome individually to foil the trap as a whole.",
										"To start with, look at your map and consider where the characters must be located to attempt an action that can foil part of the trap. Most trap designers count on the trap to protect itself. A fighter might be able to break a whirling blade, but moving close enough to attack it requires giving the blade a chance to strike.",
										"Consider how the trap can be overcome. Obvious candidates are the same sorts of checks used to defeat simple traps, but use your understanding of the trap's design to keep other options open, too. A valve leaking poison gas into a room can be stopped up. A statue emitting a deadly aura can be pushed over and smashed. Attacks, spells, and special abilities can all play a role in undermining a trap.",
										"Leave room for improvisation. If you understand the mechanism behind how a trap works, it makes it much easier for you to handle the players' ideas. Don't create a few solutions and wait for the players to guess the exact, right approach. Like everything in D&D, pick an ability, assess the chance of success, and ask for a roll.",
										"Aim at requiring three successful checks or actions to shut down one part of a trap. The first successful check might reduce the trap component's save DC or attack bonus by 4. The second successful one might halve its damage. The final successful check might shut it down.",
										"For trap components that don't attack, allow each check to reduce that element's effectiveness by one-third. A lock's DC is reduced or a gate opens wide enough to allow a Small character to squeeze through it. A mechanism pumping poison gas into the room slows down, causing the gas's damage to increase slowly or not at all.",
										"It takes time to work on a trap. Three characters can't make checks right after one another to disarm it in 6 seconds. They would get in each other's way and disrupt their efforts. Once a character succeeds on a check, another character can't attempt the same check to disable the same trap element until the end of the successful character's next turn.",
										"Not all of the characters' options must be focused on stopping a trap. Think of what characters can do to mitigate or avoid a trap's effects. This approach is a good way to make characters who might be ill -suited to disarm a trap feel useful. An Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check might reveal the pattern a swinging blade follows, giving disadvantage on its attack rolls until the start of the character's next turn. A character with a shield can stand in front of a dart trap, making themself a target each time other characters trigger it."
