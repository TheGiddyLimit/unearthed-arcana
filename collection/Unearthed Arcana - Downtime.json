						"In a typical campaign, it's possible for the characters to start at 1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a short amount of time. While that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer a campaign with pauses built into it\u2014times when adventurers do things other than go on adventures.",
						"By introducing downtime activities that take weeks, months, or even years of effort, you can give your campaign a longer timeline that allows events in the world to play out over the course of years. Wars begin and end, tyrants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall over the course of an entire lifetime of adventure.",
						"The downtime rules also provide ways for characters to spend the monetary treasure they amass on their adventures.",

These activities cover what characters at levels 1\u201310 might do between adventures. It includes buying or creating magic items, pulling off heists, and working a job. Higher level characters can also use these activities, but they have the resources and power to take on greater ambitions beyond the scope of these rules.",
								"Second, this downtime system introduces the concept of foils. Foils are NPCs who oppose the characters or whose goals put them against the party. A foil might be a villain who wishes to destroy the characters, or a good-aligned cleric who sees the characters as meddlers and troublemakers. Foils work their plots while the characters engage in downtime activities, introducing interesting complications to the campaign."

For example, you might disallow the creation of magic items, or decide that the characters are in a town that is too isolated from major markets for them to buy such items. You decide which a ctivities are available, not the players. Consider handling downtime away from the game table.

A character must spend 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity's completion. The days don't need to be consecutive.",
										"If you want multiple weeks to pass in the campaign world between sessions, report back the results of any downtime activities and ask for each character's next moves. Otherwise, you can send out the results to each player by text or email, or catch the players up at the start of the next session.",
										"If an activity requires some decisions, you can have the players decide either before the next session or at the start of it.
