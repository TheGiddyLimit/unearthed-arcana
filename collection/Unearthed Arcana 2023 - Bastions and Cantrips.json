Characters of other classes might choose one of these forms or combine them\u2014a Paladin's Bastion might be similar to a Cleric's shrine but as fortified as a Fighter's stronghold.

						"A Bastion is a location that belongs to a player character: a home, a stronghold, and a place of power that the character nurtures and develops over the course of a campaign. A Bastion offers a character temporary refuge from the dangerous world of adventuring, and it provides opportunities for a character to craft magic items, conduct research, harvest poisons, build ships, and carry out a broad range of other activities.",
						"It's up to the DM to decide whether Bastions are available in a campaign. Bastions are best suited to campaigns that allow characters to return to their Bastions during intervals when they're not actively adventuring.",
						"There's no need to choose between going on adventures and commanding a Bastion; a character can do both at once. A Bastion has special facilities that generate in-game benefits, and these facilities can also undertake projects while the character is otherwise preoccupied.",
						"Bastions are intended to be havens for the characters who own them. Although random events might test a Bastion from time to time (see the \"{@variantrule Bastion Events|XUA2023BastionsAndCantrips}\" section), the Bastion can be destroyed in only two ways (see \"{@variantrule Fall of a Bastion|XUA2023BastionsAndCantrips}\" section).",
						"Most importantly, a Bastion is a creative playground for a player and a shared storytelling space in the campaign. DMs should be as permissive as possible with the stories players tell in their Bastions, but players should know their control goes only as far as the campaign's larger story, which the DM strives to make fun for everyone.",
