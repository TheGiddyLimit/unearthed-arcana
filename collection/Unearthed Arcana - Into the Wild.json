						"The rules for wilderness travel in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide and chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook allow a DM to track a party's progress for each hour of travel. Those rules work similarly to the rules for dungeon navigation, in that the players pick a direction and strike off in search of adventure, adjusting their path as they go.",
						"What I noticed in my own campaigns, though, was that players tended to focus primarily on their destination in wilderness travel. In a dungeon, players think in terms of opening the door to the east, or investigating the passage to the north. Their choices are tactical in nature, and based on the immediate environment. Adventurers might be seeking a lost shrine in a dungeon, but the decisions they make along the way are all important and interesting.",
						"In the wilderness, most situations allow the characters to travel in any direction they choose. Their choices are circumstantial rather than tactical. So when the characters decide to seek out a ruined temple in the forest, the choices they make along the way matter less than that initial big-picture decision.",
						"The following approach to wilderness exploration and travel provides a new overlay for the existing rules from the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Player's Handbook. They're built around the idea that the players have a specific destination in mind as the party sets out for the day. They also require that you take a new approach to designing the wilderness regions of your campaign as a DM.",
