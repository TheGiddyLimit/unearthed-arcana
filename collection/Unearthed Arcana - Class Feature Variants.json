This friendship can arise from successful use of the {@skill Animal Handling} skill or the {@spell animal friendship} spell. If the resulting bond is strong enough, the animal might join the ranger on adventures.",
				"A ranger who has the Beast Master archetype can form an even stronger bond, feeling almost like a sibling to an animal. A special type of beast awaits a Beast Master in the wilds, a creature whose lineage stretches back to the beginnings of the world: a primal beast known as a {@creature Beast of the Air|UAClassFeatureVariants} or a {@creature Beast of the Earth|UAClassFeatureVariants}. Such a creature seeks out the type of companionship that a Beast Master offers, ready for the two of them to battle the imbalances in the natural world.",
				"The primal beast is a special creature that a Beast Master can choose for the Ranger's Companion feature. When choosing such a creature, you decide whether it is a Beast of the Air or the Earth, and you determine its appearance. Stories describe primal beasts that mystically change form to align with the spirit of their companion.",
				"When a primal beast is met apart from a Beast Master, the creature takes the form a regular beast of challenge rating 1/4 or lower, as determined by the DM."
