						"This edition of Unearthed {@skill Arcana} introduces an alternative set of encounter-building guidelines for D&D. Though this approach uses the same basic math underlying the encounter system presented in the Dungeon Master's Guide, it makes a few adjustments to how it presents that math to produce a more flexible system.",

It'll be of interest to any DMs who want to emphasize combat in their games, who want to ensure that a foe isn't too deadly for a specific group of characters, and who want to understand the relationship between a character's level and a monster's challenge rating.",

								"To build an encounter using this system, first take stock of the player characters. This system uses the characters' levels to determine the number and challenge rating of creatures you can pit them against without making a fight too hard or too easy. But though character level is important, you should also take note of each characters' hit point maximum and saving throw modifiers, as well as how much damage the strongest combatants or spellcasters can inflict with a single attack. Even though character level and challenge rating are useful tools for defining the difficulty of an encounter, they don't tell the whole story, and you'll make use of these additional character statistics when you select monsters for an encounter in step 4."

										"A few elements that make the battlefield interesting can go a long way toward making an encounter more memorable. As a good rule of thumb, try to set up the area of the battle so that it would be challenging even without a fight taking place there. What things might draw the characters' attention? Why are monsters lurking here? Interesting area features can help prompt improvisation and keep things fresh.",

Do creatures gather there to eat or gossip? Are there any natural phenomena such as strong winds, earth tremors, or rain squalls that sometimes take place in the area? Random events are fun because they add an element of the unexpected to an encounter. Just when you think a fight's outcome is clear, an unexpected event can make things more interesting.",
										"A number of the tables in the Dungeon Master's Guide can suggest random events to be added to a location, depending on the nature of the encounter setup. The tables used for encounter location, weird locales, and wilderness weather in chapter 5, \"Adventure Environments,\" of the Dungeon Master's Guide are a good starting point for outdoor encounters. The tables in appendix A, \"Random Dungeons,\" can be useful for indoor and outdoor encounters\u2014especially the tables for obstacles, traps, and tricks."
