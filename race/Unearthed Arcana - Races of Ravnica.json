										"Viashino accept, collect, and discard names freely, choosing names that fit their current sense of self or whim. Sometimes they'll string two or more names together, because they like the sound or because all the names feel meaningful and relevant at the time. As a result, members of other races often have a hard time keeping track of a viashino's name.",
